# MSC-Neural-Networks

This repository contains the Neural Networks projects assigned by Microsoft Student Club, SJTU

The initial idea and the code are based on the repository microsoft\ai-edu. Many thanks to Microsoft Research, Asia that creates this repository and makes neural networks accessible to students in China. If there's a contradiction between my license and the license required by Microsoft, the latter applys.

If you found any problems in the repository, please create an issue or contact me through email.
